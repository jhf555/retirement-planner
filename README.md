# retirement-planner
Provides a tool for approximating when you can retire based on your age,
income, investments, etc.  This is meant as one tool and nothing more, use             
the calculations it provides at your own risk.  This tool should not be used           
as a substitute for other financial planning methods.                                  
 
This script might be missing some things, e.g. tax consideration, property values,     
etc.
